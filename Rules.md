# Rules

## Meta-rules:

1. All rules should be able to fit on 1 sheet of paper (double-sided, of course)
2. Rules should be in "heuristic" form (simple rules-of-thumb, [see here]())
3. Rules shouldn't be too specific (they are open to some interpretation)
4. Each rule must be based on guiding principles or general time-tested observations

## For part-time contractors

## For team members
