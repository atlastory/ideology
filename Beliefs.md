# Beliefs & Models

#### History rhymes ∴ understanding history => better future

Events throughout history have a tendancy to "rhyme" with [others that have gone before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_recurrence). Understanding the drivers, motivations, and consequences of historic events help us avoid past mistakes and make decisions that lead to a better future.

> "…a favorite theory of mine—to wit, that no *occurrence* is sole and solitary, but is merely a repetition of a thing which has happened before, and perhaps often." — **Mark Twain**

#### There will always be value in organizing, parsing, and clarifying data

There's a lot of data out there. And it's getting bigger at an ever-increasing rate. Organizing and enabling the increased understanding of this data will only become more valuable over time. Good information design can communicate a huge amount of knowledge in a small window of time or space.

> "To envision information—and what bright and splendid visions can result—is to work at the intersection of image, word, number, art." — **Edward Tufte**

#### Technology wants structure, beauty, and ubiquity

In *What Technology Wants*, Kevin Kelly considers the intrinsic "desires" of technology as it evolves alongside life. Three of the wants he lists are structure, beauty, and ubiquity.

Technology wants **structure**. As technology evolves, the amount of knowledge and information it produces increases exponentially. Like natural evolution, this information moves towards structure and organization over time.

Technology wants **beauty**. The most beautiful things are the most highly evolved. It has less to do with smooth lines and more to do with smooth continuity of experience. Year by year, as it advances, technology, on average, will increase in beauty.

Technology wants **ubiquity**. The rate of diffusion of technologies is accelerating, from electricity taking 75 years to cell phones taking 20 years. Ubiquity changes everything. What happens when something becomes ubiquitous? What happens when everyone has one?


### Model: Signal-to-noise ratio

The ratio of relevant to irrelevant information in a display. The highest possible signal-to-noise ratio is desirable in design. Another equivalent principle is the **data-ink ratio**: data-ink ÷ total ink/pixels.

> “A large share of ink on a graphic should represent data- information, the ink changing as the data change. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.” -- **Edward Tufte**

All communication involves the transmission of information, during which the **signal** (information) is degraded, and **noise** (extraneous information) is added. Noise reduces clarity by diluting useful information with useless information. Maximizing signal means clearly communicating information with minimal degradation.

Visual activation of negative areas of white space illustrates the contextual and interactive nature of visual elements. This idea is captured in a fundamental principle of information design: *1 + 1 = 3 or more*. This effect means any unnecessary visual input produces a multiplier of noise. Careful editing diminishes 1 + 1 = 3 clutter. These are not trivial cosmetic matters — signal enhancement through noise reduction can reduce viewer fatigue as well as improve accuracy of readings.

Signal **clarity** is improved through simple and concise presentation of information. Minimizing noise means removing unnecessary elements, and minimizing necessary elements to the degree possible without compromising function. For example, lines should be removed if possible unless it subtracts from meaning, in which case they should be thinned or lightened.

Clarity is not everything, but there is little with-out it. Every element in a design should be expressed to the extent necessary, but not beyond the extent necessary.

### Model: Clarity vs. complexity

**There is no correlation between complexity and confusion**, or simpleness and clarity. It all comes down to good design.

Low-density designs require viewers to rely on visual memory — a weak skill — to make a contrast, a comparison, or a choice. High-density designs allow viewers to select, to narrate, to recast and personalize data for their own uses.

> “It is not how much empty space there is, but rather how it is used. It is not how much information there is, but rather how effectively it is arranged.” -- **Edward Tufte**

The quantity of detail is an issue completely separate from the difficulty of reading. *Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information.* Simpleness is another aesthetic preference, not an information display strategy, not a guide to clarity. The deepest reason for displays that portray complexity and intricacy is that the worlds we seek to understand are complex and intricate.
