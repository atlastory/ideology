# Beliefs & Models

#### History rhymes ∴ understanding history => better future

Events throughout history have a tendancy to "rhyme" with [others that have gone before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_recurrence). Understanding the drivers, motivations, and consequences of historic events help us avoid past mistakes and make decisions that lead to a better future.

#### There will always be value in organizing, parsing, and clarifying data

There's a lot of data out there. And it's getting bigger at an ever-increasing rate. Organizing and enabling the increased understanding of this data will only become more valuable over time. Good information design can communicate a huge amount of knowledge in a small window of time or space.

> "To envision information—and what bright and splendid visions can result—is to work at the intersection of image, word, number, art." — **Edward Tufte**

#### Technology wants structure, beauty, and ubiquity

In *What Technology Wants*, Kevin Kelly considers the intrinsic "desires" of technology as it evolves alongside life. Three of the wants he lists are structure, beauty, and ubiquity.

Technology wants **structure**. As technology evolves, the amount of knowledge and information it produces increases exponentially. Like natural evolution, this information moves towards structure and organization over time.

Technology wants **beauty**. The most beautiful things are the most highly evolved. It has less to do with smooth lines and more to do with smooth continuity of experience. Year by year, as it advances, technology, on average, will increase in beauty.

Technology wants **ubiquity**. The rate of diffusion of technologies is accelerating, from electricity taking 75 years to cell phones taking 20 years. Ubiquity changes everything. What happens when something becomes ubiquitous? What happens when everyone has one?
